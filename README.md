​
### **Colour Scheme:**
We wanted ​the site to feel futuristic and make the user feel like their encounter with something innovative and cool. Since we focus a lot on personal development and self-improvement our chosen colours which represent that. 

​![colour-scheme](docs/images/color-palette.png)

Our main colour is green (#00C853), it used to be associated with something fresh, innovation and growth. 
We also have to kinds of blue accent colours, one lighter shade (#00E5FF) and one dark shade (#1A237E). Blue colours make people feel trust and bring calm. The lighter one is also a fresh, innovative and clear colour which is very visible, because of that we have chosen not to use it too frequently, only for details, so the user thinks the site is a pain to visit. The darker shade symbolises depth and is a bit mysterious, which also suits NeuroNova good because neurohacking is a quite unexplored area for most people. 
We have also a light (#F5F5F5) and a dark shade (F212121) to make it easier to match colours in back- and foreground in a harmonic and pleasant way. 

We decided to change the use for the colours and focus on a darker background and lighter colours for body text and headings, because we thought it would align more with the site's purpose and feeling and thought we want our users to have.

​
## **Typography**
​​![Typography](docs/images/typography.png)
* Throughout the page, there are two fonts used:
  * [Proxima Nova](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/proxima-nova) - Font-weight bold - used for headings, navigation and buttons. Buttons and navigation have uppercase applied as a text transform to make them pop compared to other text.
  * [Open Sans](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/open-sans) - For the rest of the element, such as body text and our form. 
​
* Proxima Nova and Open Sans are a great font pair, proxima as a tougher, bold font which open sans smooth can work together with without being too much.
* All fonts were sourced from Adobe fonts through a link to the web type-kit we have created, which is linked under [Content](#content)

1. Live simulation of the site through VS Code.
2. Published page on GitHub. 

Ways we have used Dev Tools to test functionality:
1. Navigation
    * **Expected:** When the user clicks one of the links, the navigation should take the user to that section of the page. 
    * **Testing:** We tested the navigation by clicking all links in the navigation on both desktop and mobile devices. The tests were performed on different sections of the page to see that the functionality was not bound to a specific part of the page e.g. top.
    * **Result:** Works as expected.

2. Sticky header
    * **Expected:** The header should stick to the top of the page when the user is scrolling down. 
    * **Testing:** Scrolling up and down the page on both desktop and mobile devices to ensure the header follows.
    * **Result:** Works as expected.

3. Dropdown
    * **Expected:** When the user clicks the hamburger menu on smaller devices, the dropdown should appear. If the dropdown is visible, it should disappear when the user clicks the x.
    * **Testing:** Clicked the hamburger menu on smaller devices and the x when the dropdown is visible.
    * **Result:** Works as expected.

4. Call to action-button on hero section
    * **Expected:** When the user clicks the call to action, the site should scroll down to the subscription form.
    * **Testing:** Clicked the call to action button on both desktop and mobile devices.
    * **Result:** Works as expected.

5. Validation subscription form
    * **Expected:** If the user does not fill the form correctly, the form should tell the user to fill the form correctly.
    * **Testing:** Tested to send an empty form, tested to fill only one field at once, tested to not fill an email address, testet to not accept terms.
    * **Result:** Works as expected, the form is invalid and a message appears to the user.

* We tested both desktop and mobile.

# **Desktop**
Overall a good score both on desktop and mobile.
![Lighthouse desktop](docs/images/lighthouse-desktop.png)
## **Improvements to be made:**
### Performance - 97/100
* Eliminate render-blocking resources: 
We understand the importance of eliminating render-blocking resources to improve website loading times and user experience. However, our website is hosted on a GitHub server, which limits our control over server configurations and resource handling. This restriction makes it challenging to fully address the issue. Nonetheless, we are actively exploring possible solutions and improvements within the constraints of the GitHub server environment.

* Serve images in modern formats
After careful consideration and testing, we have decided not to implement next-gen formats for our website's background images. Our findings indicate that the use of next-gen formats in this particular case does not improve, and in fact, hinders our website's performance, leading to a suboptimal user experience. We believe that the potential benefits of next-gen formats are outweighed by the drawbacks in this specific scenario. However, it's important to note that we have implemented a fallback system for our HTML images, ensuring that they are served in next-gen formats when supported by the browser. This approach allows us to leverage the advantages of next-gen formats where applicable, while maintaining optimal performance and user experience for our background images.

# **Mobile**
![Lighthouse mobile](docs/images/lighthouse-mobile.png)
#### **Performance** 84/100
* Eliminate render-blocking resources
Explained above. 

* Serve images in modern formats
Explained above.

#### **SEO** 97/100
* Tap targets are not sized appropriately
After thorough testing and consideration, we have decided not to address the "tap targets are not sized appropriately" issue. Our decision is based on the results of our extensive testing on mobile devices, which showed that users do not experience any difficulties interacting with the element in question. We believe that our user interface is already optimized for a seamless and user-friendly experience on mobile devices. As a result, we have concluded that resolving this specific issue is not necessary at this time.



## **Bugs**
During the project a lot of bugs appeared during development and deployment. We believe we have solved most of the issues that occured to get a functional website. 

**Overflow on smaller screens**
* **Issue** - On smaller screens it was possible to scroll horizontally. We could see this during our manual testing. 
* **Cause** - The FAQs styling was not optimised enough and made it go out of the screen. 
* **Solution** - Changed width to auto for screens 720px or below, which solved the problem.  

**Non-visible images**
* **Issue:** - During development and after deployment we noticed that images in the directory would not appear on the website.
* **Cause:** - The path to some of the images was not relative, making them non-visible on Github pages. 
* **Solution** - By changing all images and making new paths the images work as expected.
