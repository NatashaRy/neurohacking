​
​
### **Wireframes:**
​
![desktop-wireframes](docs\images\desktop.png) ![tablet-wireframes](docs\images\tablet.png) ![mobile-wireframes](docs\images\mobile.png)
​
### **Color Scheme:**
​![color-scheme](docs\images\ui-elements-color-palette.png)
We wanted ​the site to feel futurustic and make the user feel like like their encounting with something innovative and cool. Since we focus a lot on personal development and self-improvement our chosen colors which represent that. 

Our main color is green (#00C853), it use to be associated with something fresh, innovation and growth. 
We also have to kinds of blue accent colors, one lighter shade (#00E5FF) and one dark shade (#1A237E). Blue colors make people feel trust and brings calm. The lighter one is also a fresh, innovative and clear color which is very visible, because of that we have chosen not to use it too frequently, only for details, so the user think the site is a pain to visit. The darker shade symbolises depth and are a bit mystorius, which also suites NeuroNova good because neurohacking is a quite unexplored area for most people. 
We have also a light (#F5F5F5) and a dark shade (F212121) to make it easier to match colors in back- and forground in a harmonic and plesant way. 

We decided to change the use for the colors and focus on a darker background and lighter colors for body text and headings, because we thoguht it would align more with the sites purpose and feeling and thought we want our users to have.

​
## **Typography**
​​![Typography](docs\images\ui-elements-typography.png)
* Throughout the page, there are two fonts used:
  * Proxima Nova - Font-weight bold - used for headings, navigation and buttons. Buttons and navigation have uppercase applied as a text transform to make them pop compared to other text.
  * Open Sans - For rest of the element, such as body text and our form. 
​
* Proxima Nova and Open Sans are a great font pair, proxima as a thougher, bold font which open sans smooth can work together with without being to much.
* All fonts were sourced from Adobe fonts through a link to the webtyp-kit we have created.
​
## **Current Features Common to all pages**
​
#### *Navigation Bar:*
* Provide links to all sections: The navigation bar provides direct links to each section of the page, ensuring users can quickly jump to the content they're interested in.
* Clear Presentation: Each navigation option is presented in a clear, readable font and style, ensuring users can easily identify where they want to go.
* Mobile Optimization: For users on smaller screens, a hamburger menu is provided. This ensures that mobile users have an optimal, clutter-free experience.

#### *Hero section:*
The hero section is the first thing users see when they visit the site. It sets the tone and introduces them to the concept of neurohacking.

* Engaging Visuals: The hero section features captivating visuals that draw users in and pique their interest in neurohacking.
* Clear Call to Action: A clear and compelling call to action encourages users to learn more or take the next step in their neurohacking journey.

#### *About section:*
This section delves into the concept of neurohacking, providing users with a comprehensive overview.

* Informative Content: Users are presented with well-researched and easy-to-understand information about neurohacking.
* Engaging Layout: Short and concise content is laid out in a way that's engaging and easy to digest.


​
## **Future-Enhancements**
​
A website is always evolving, and there are plans to further enhance the neurohacking site to provide an even better user experience.

* Email Integration: At the time of creating this page, there was no capability to send emails from the contact form. In the future, integrating with services like email.js will allow users to send emails directly from the site, enhancing the user experience.

* Interactive JS Game: Given the intriguing subject matter of neurohacking, there's a plan to include a small JavaScript-based game. This will engage users further, providing both entertainment and education about neurohacking concepts.


​
## **Testing Phase**
​
This is the hardest bit of the readme, when we have completed a page we need to discuss testing.
​
Here is a good idea to talk about how and why you have tested with certain tools and validators so here a list of things to talk through
​
* Responsiveness - How do you test this, dev tools? checking on multiple devices?
​
* Functionality - Each feature needs to be tested before something is complete, talk about the process, click each link check each image, does form validation work, if your using javascript or anything else, does it always behave as the user expects
​
* Validators - Here include images from w3c html validator and css jigsaw (jshint for js and pep8 for python) and the results that came from it

### **Manual testing:**
NeuroNova has been tested for resposivness in the following ways:

# **Resposiveness**
We have tested this to see the that the user will get the same experience visiting our website, no matter what device they choose to use. 

* Chrome dev tools - We have used Chrome Dev Tools to check the responsiveness of the website. 

We have tested the site with Dev Tools in the following ways:
1. Live simulation of the site thought VS Code.
2. Published page on GitHub. 

Ways we have used Dev Tools:
1. Narrowed the screen when opening Dev Tools.
2. Checked different devices and dimensions.

# **Different devices**
We have also tested the website manually on different devices to check the responsivness. 
The devices we have used are:
1. Monitors
    * 2560 1440 px
    * 2560 x 1080 px
2. Mobile phones
    * Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra
    * Samsung Galaxy A54
3. Tablet 
    * Ipad Air


## **Functionality:**
During the manual testing we also tested the websites functionality so the users get what they expect visiting our website. 

## **Validators:**
# **CSS** - https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ 
No errors were found.
![W3C CSS-validator](docs\images\w3c-css-validation.png)

# **HTML** - https://validator.w3.org/nu/ 
No errors were found.
![W3C HTML validator](docs\images\w3c-html-validator.png)

## **Lighthouse score**
​We also tested the site in Lighthouse. 
* The test were preformed in incognito mode to get more accurate results
* We tested both desktop and mobile

# **Desktop**
Over all a good score both on desktop and mobile.
Improvment to be made:
* Performance: Change som image elements (that is not working at the moment).
* Accessibility: The iframe we tried to fix and a contrast issue, which do not appear when the background image are working as it is supposed to.
![Ligthouse desktop](docs\images\lighthouse-desktop.png)

# **Mobile**
Improvments to be made are the same desktop exept render-blocking should be eliminated on mobile aswell.

## **Bugs**
​
During the project a lot of bugs appeard during development and deployment. We belive we have solved most of the issues that occured to get a fuctional website. 

**Responsive navigation menu**
* Issue - Mobile menu is only working in Chrome developer tools. It does not work on mobile devices (Samsung Galaxy s22 Ultra) at all.
* Cause - What causes the problem is uncertain at this momemnt. We've tried different kinds of menus on mobile but get the same issue. I have not found a resolution for this bug yet.
* Resolution - Due to limited time, we chose to make a temporary solution and add an extra section for the menu in smaller units. We know that it is not an optimal solution, but it contributes to the site's functionality and is kept within the framework of the deadline.
​
**Overflow on smaller screens**
* Issue - On smaller screens it was possibke to scroll horizontal. We could see this during our manual testing. 
* Cause - The FAQs styling were not optimized enough with made it go out of the screen. 
* Resolution - Changed width to auto for screens 720px or below, which solve the problem.  

**Non-visible images**
* Issue - During development and after deployment we noticed that images in the directory would not apperear on the website.
* Cause - The path to some of the images was not relative, make them non-visable on Github pages. 
* Resolution - Changing the path to the source and some of the images got visible. Since this method did not work on the background image we chose to upload it to Google Drive and use the url provided from there for the background image. 
​
***
## **Deployment**
I deployed the page on GitHub pages via the following procedure: -
​
1. From the project's [repository](https://github.com/NatashaRy/neurohacking), go to the **Settings** tab.
2. From the left-hand menu, select the **Pages** tab.
3. Under the **Source** section, select the **Main** branch from the drop-down menu and click **Save**.
4. A message will be displayed to indicate a successful deployment to GitHub pages and provide the live link.
